# C-Compiler
This project was developed as part of the "20465 - Systems Programming Laboratory" 2023B course at the Open University. It's a comprehensive assembler program for a specific assembly language, written in C. The purpose is to simulate the operation of common system programs, and thus experience writing a large-scale software project.
The project consists of multiple C and header files, each serving a specific purpose in the program. It adheres to principles of clarity, readability, structured writing, and data abstraction.

The assembler works in three main stages:

Pre-Processing
First Pass
Second Pass
These stages form the core algorithm of the assembler.
